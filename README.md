tinyfsm-playground
==================
Based on [digint/tinyfsm](https://github.com/digint/tinyfsm)'s offical code example "elevator".

### Notes
- C++11 is required
- tinyfsm is a header-only library, does not need compilation

### TODOs
- [ ] add expected parameters as in offical [Makefile](https://github.com/digint/tinyfsm/blob/master/examples/elevator/Makefile)
